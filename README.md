Django Blog contains the Phase 2 Selection assignment.

AndroidStudioChat.zip contains the Phase 3 Selection assignment.
There was some error while uploading the whole folder.

Updated AndroidStudioChat.zip

Chats coming soon... I just have to query the database for the user's contacts and add a ChatActivity where both users will talk and their chat would be stored in the database. The ChatActivity would be similar to GroupChat Activity.

Also the ChatsFragment would display previous Chats, which can be also done by a query similar to filtering contacts from all users.
